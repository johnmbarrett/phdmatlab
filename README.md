# ABANDON ALL HOPE YE WHO ENTER HERE

If you stumbled across this repository somehow, turn back.  There is nothing for you here.

This is almost all the Matlab code I wrote during my PhD.  It is completely disorganised, is not and will never be documented, and was written to work---usually only for one very specific purpose---rather than to be maintaintable, but I wanted to put it /somewhere/ in case I ever lose access to my old University's servers and my various hard drives.  Additionally, much of it depends on various third-party code: mostly stuff from File Exchange, various neuroscience-specific toolboxes (particularly the FIND toolbox, and untold bits of code from random papers or scientists' websites, some of which may have ceased to exist by the time you (or I) come to read this.  I removed most (all?) of these before I uploaded this repository.  Good luck finding them all again.

With the exception of getopt.m in the folder jonas, which was written by Dr Jonas B. Zimmerman, all of this code should have been written by me.  If by some horrible twist of fate you find it useful, I don't care what you do with it or whether you credit me.  As hinted at above, there may be some third party bits of code that I forgot to remove before I uploaded this.  If you find some of your code here and want it taken down, please ask.
